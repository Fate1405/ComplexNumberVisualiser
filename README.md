# ComplexNumberVisualiser

This is a graphical visualiser (graph) of a complex function of the form $f(a+bi)=c+di$. As the input and output comprise 4 dimensions in total, the only ways to plot these functions visually is via level curve diagrams, colour maps or linear maps. However, these do not fully describe the behaviour of a complex function, indeed, instead the magnitude of the complex output (the $l_2$ norm), given by $\sqrt(c^2+d^2)$ was plotted on the third axis instead.

This repo also contains a classical implementation of complex numbers with all the basic operations ($+-\div \times$) included. An example plot of the function $f(a+bi)=(a+bi)^2$ is shown below.
